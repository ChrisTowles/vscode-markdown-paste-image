## Credits

I wanted to make this plugin after issues with markdown image paste [mushan.vscode-paste-image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image). After looking for an alternative and finding out that it looked like there were half a [dozen copies](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=image%20paste%20markdown&target=VSCode&category=Other&sortBy=Relevance) and most were forks, or no longer maintained.

I decided to use [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu)'s repo for [vscode-smart-clicks](https://github.com/antfu/vscode-smart-clicks) as a starting point. And then build from there to have the features that I wanted.
