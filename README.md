## Installation

Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.

```bash
ext install chris-towles.markdown-paste-image
```

## Features

- Paste image from clipboard into markdown
- prompts for the file name or uses the selected text as the file name.
- Save clipboard image as `PNG` file and insert image markdown.

There are other plugins that had this feature, but they were not maintained, had bugs, or had tons of features I didn't want. So here is a simple extension that does one thing and one thing only and does it with [tests](https://github.com/ChrisTowles/vscode-markdown-paste-image/actions)!

## Requirements

- `xclip` command be required (Linux)
- `powershell` command be required (Win32)
- `pbpaste` command be required (Mac)

## Credits

I wanted to make this plugin after issues with markdown image paste [mushan.vscode-paste-image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image). After looking for an alternative and finding out that it looked like there were half a [dozen copies](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=image%20paste%20markdown&target=VSCode&category=Other&sortBy=Relevance) and most were forks, or no longer maintained.

I decided to use [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu)'s repo for [vscode-smart-clicks](https://github.com/antfu/vscode-smart-clicks) as a starting point. And then build from there to have the features that I wanted.
